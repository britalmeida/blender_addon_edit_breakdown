# Edit Breakdown

Get insight on the complexity of an edit.

## Usage (WIP)
1. In the Sequencer, have a strip represent each shot in the edit.
2. Open a new `Sequencer` area in `Preview` mode, and toggle `Display Channels` to `Color`.
This is the current sub-optimal way of toggling the thumbnail view on/off, as unfortunately, it is not possible to add new toggles to the sequencer.
3. Click the Sync button to generate shots and thumbnails.

## Installation

1. Download this repository as ZIP file.
2. In Blender's `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons`, click `Install` and select the ZIP.

### Updating

1. Download the newest version ZIP.
2. In Blender's `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons`, find this add-on, expand it, and click `Remove`.
3. Click `Install` and select the ZIP.

**Alternatively:** this repository can be **cloned** to a folder on disk and that folder linked to the `scripts/addons` folder of the Blender executable. This way, the add-on and be kept up to date with `git pull` without the need to remove/install it.

### Requirements
- Blender 2.91 or later.
